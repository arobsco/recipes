5. Transfer in to a container and keep at 25°C
6. Perform 4 folds of the dough repeated 4 times at 30min intervals
### ~ 8pm

14. Ensure there is no seam by pinching together and shaping carefully
15. Place in a warm area around 25°C for six hours
### ~ 5pm
16. By now the dough should be a lot more relaxed and disc like
17. Preheat your oven as hot as it will go for at least 30mins. This may need to be longer, especially if using a pizza stone
18. While the oven is preheating place the dough in the fridge to firm it up an make it easier to shape
19. Prepare your toppings
20. After the dough has been in the fridge for 30mins remove it and lightly flour your worktop
21. Shape your dough to the shape you want using your favourite pizza shaping technique
22. Once shaped transfer to greaseproof paper and pizza slice if using
23. Turn on the grill and oven mode of your oven if it has this setting. If not just leave as oven
24. Add your pizza sauce and toppings
25. Once pizza is ready quickly and carefully transfer to the oven and quickly spray the edges with water using a spray gun
26. If you have turned on grill mode then turn it off after two mins, back to normal oven mode
27. Three mins after first putting the pizza in the oven rotate the pizza 180°
28. Bake for around 5mins or until cooked
